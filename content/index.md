Trident Moon promotes the practice of Aṣṭāṅga Yoga and meditation in Eastern Kentucky.  It is a labor of love, the fruit of decades of study of Yoga and the classical Indian philosophical, religious and meditative traditions within which it has been variously cultivated.

If Yoga were only a system for physical health that leads to happiness in one's body, that would be marvellous enough, but experience shows that through the disciplined and unassuming practice of Yoga one is also opened, over time, to encounter with the Mystery of God, in whom we all live, move and have our being.
